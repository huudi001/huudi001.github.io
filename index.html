    <p>Hi! am khalid i love programing, running and swimming. i was born and raised in mombasa/kenya. i finish my secondery school there. however due  to family culture i was pressured not to pursue higher educaction so i ran the family bussines along with my father, however that did not stop from self-learning, so whenever i had the time i took that opportunity to take online courses, specifically programming courses<br />

    right now i am a student at Moringaschool learnin the foundations of software devlopment. this preparation course will continue for 5 weeks.<br />
    almost right at the end of this course a more advanced and in-depth fulstack web and app development will presume.
    this is the Moringa-core program.
    Founded in April 2014, Moringa School plays a crucial role in developing and nurturing highly potential individuals who are passionate about technology and want to take a lead role in mobile and web development through equipping them with life long skills<br />.
Through  top quality teachers, to  intensive curriculum moringa is creating world-class developers in Africa with the help of its partnership with Hack Reactor and many other coding schools from all around the world.
Moringa is dedicated to committing the majority of its  profits back to their main mission of transforming higher education in Africa.
<br />
Jeremy jhonson the co-founder of andela a startup tech-company said ''briliancy is divided evenly but opportunity  is not'', in this continent that we live in opportunity is created, previleged people make a small percentage of the population whereas majority of the population have to strive to try and create opportunities and most dont make it.
institutions like moringa school are among the few that bring opportunites to briliant minds that await to be unleashed. this minds are the ones that will take a great in hand in making revolutionary changes that will make life easier in africa and the world.
<br />
with that said am in the final stages of the moringa which focuses on on front-end development and lays the foundations the foundation to the more advanced moringa-core prgram that has two variations an androd and java mobile development and fulstsack webdevelopment wich ususes python and django framework, i opted for for fulstack since i like  python.
here are links to the projects i have done so far.
