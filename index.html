    <p>Hi! am khalid i love programing, running and swimming.<br />
    <br />
    right now i am a student at Moringaschool learnin the foundations of software devlopment. this preparation course will continue for 5 weeks.<br />
    almost right at the end of this course a more advanced and in-depth fulstack web and app development will presume.
    this is the Moringa-core program.<br ?>
    <br />
    Founded in April 2014, Moringa School plays a crucial role in developing and nurturing highly potential individuals who are passionate about technology and want to take a lead role in mobile and web development through equipping them with life long skills<br />.
Through  top quality teachers, to  intensive curriculum moringa is creating world-class developers in Africa with the help of its partnership with Hack Reactor and many other coding schools from all around the world.
Moringa is dedicated to committing the majority of its  profits back to their main mission of transforming higher education in Africa.
<br />
so my first day at moringa was intresting and fun the staff introduced them selfes and as soon as they started introducing themselfs it seemed as if they were fellow students.
our technical mentor is a guy called Andrew,a cool down to earth fellow who never seizes to laugh.
moringa school as you may be aware of employs the flipped classrom strategy, the accurate defintion of fliiped clasroom is; Flipped Learning is a
pedagogical approach in
which direct instruction moves
from the group learning space
to the individual learning
space, and the resulting
group space is transformed
into a dynamic, interactive
learning environment where
the educator guides students
as they apply concepts and
engage creatively in the
subject matter.
